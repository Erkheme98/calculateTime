# calculateTime
Calculating time from angular velocity, wheel radius, and distance.
Theory:
v = w*r
v=d/t
t=d/w
where linear velocity is v, distance is d, time is t, and angular velocity is w.
# calculateTime

This project calculates the time required to travel a given distance based on angular velocity, wheel radius, and distance.

## Files

- `calculate_time.py`: The main script that performs the calculations and simulates the motion.

## Usage

To run the script, execute the following command:

```sh
./calculate_time.py
